## Description

This module contains classes to configure the PDS on Puppet servers, or to configure the PostgreSQL database backend on PE PostgreSQL servers.

See also: [Puppet Data Service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-data-service)

## Installation

1. Add the `puppet_data_service` module to the Puppetfile in your control-repo

```ruby
mod 'puppet_data_service',
  git:    'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppet_data_service',
  branch: 'main'
```

1. Include the [PDS Hiera level](#hiera-backend) in your control-repo's `hiera.yaml` file

## Usage

For the database server:

```puppet
include puppet_data_service::database
```

For Puppet servers:

```puppet
class { 'puppet_data_service::server':
  database_host => 'database.example.com',
  pds_token     => Sensitive('a-secure-admin-token'),
}
```

### Hiera backend

This will automatically load configuration from the default file, `/etc/puppetlabs/pds/pds-client.yaml`.

```yaml
  - name: "Puppet Data Service"
    data_hash: puppet_data_service::data_hash
    uris:
      - "nodes/%{trusted.certname}"
      - "os/%{operatingsystem}"
      - "common"
    options:
      # By default, the backend loads its configuration from 
      # /etc/puppetlabs/pds-server/pds-cli.yaml. If the file does not exist,
      # or if the file does not contain the required values, the backend will
      # raise an exception and halt. Setting `on_config_absent` to "continue"
      # will cause the backend to instead return `not_found` and continue.
      on_config_absent: "continue"
```

This includes the required options directly. The configuration file does not need to exist or contain options.

Servers may optionally include the scheme `http://` or `https://` (default is `https://`). The port is not configurable at this time, and is expected to be 8160.

```yaml
  - name: "Puppet Data Service"
    data_hash: puppet_data_service::data_hash
    uris:
      - "nodes/%{trusted.certname}"
      - "os/%{operatingsystem}"
      - "common"
    options:
      token: admintoken
      servers:
       - pe-server-c37144-0.us-west1-a.c.puppet-solutions-architects.internal
       - pe-server-c37144-1.us-west1-b.c.puppet-solutions-architects.internal
```
